# SPARK - Smart Parking AI-Driven RZBoard Kit

Welcome to SPARK, the cutting-edge solution for smart EV charging and parking lot management. Utilizing AI algorithms on the edge, YOLOv3 on RZBoard, SPARK revolutionizes parking efficiency and user experience.

## Overview

SPARK is an effective EV charging prototype that integrates YOLO (You Only Look Once) for real-time occupancy detection with the robust RZBoard V2L for a parking lot occupancy/EV charging experience. This system is designed to automate parking lot analysis, streaming edge compute data to your desired target: an information hub like IoT Connect, or an HDMI output. The result: improved user-experience for EV charging customers and parking lot managers.

## Features

- **Real-Time Occupancy Detection**: Using YOLO, SPARK detects vehicle occupancy in real-time, ensuring accurate information on parking availability.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use interface demo interface: output data to HDMI for simple viewing. Or, integrate with IoT connect for bootstrapped dashboards.
- **Sustainable Solution**: Promotes efficient energy use and supports the growing need for EV infrastructure.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to scale: one image could host up to 200 parking spots. Try adding more parking slots and/or images until your FPS requirement isn't met. Then, scale horizontally with more RZBoards connected to your IoT connect style HUB!

## Installation

Detailed instructions on how to set up and install SPARK on your RZBoard will be provided here. **You are expected to build this from inside the RZBoard AI SDK**

```bash
# Example installation code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SPARK.git
cd SPARK
# further installation instructions
TODO!
```

## Usage

Provide a quick start guide or examples on how to use the system once installed.

```bash
# Example usage code
cd SPARK
TODO
# Add code snippets or command-line examples
```
